name: insufficient entropy
cwe: 331
description: The affected device may use insufficient entropy to generate cryptographic keys, making it easier for attackers to predict or brute-force the keys and compromise the security of encrypted communications.
mitigations:
- description: Use a cryptographic random number generator (RNG) to ensure sufficient entropy for generating cryptographic keys. Use libraries or APIs specifically designed for secure random number generation.
  phase: Implementation
- description: Regularly test the cryptographic keys generated by the device to ensure they exhibit the expected level of randomness and entropy. Replace weak or predictable keys with stronger ones.
  phase: Maintaince
- description:   Ensure that cryptographic keys generated have sufficient length and strength to resist brute-force attacks. Use industry-recommended key lengths for encryption algorithms.
  phase: Architecture

risk:
- consequence: Compromise of cryptographic keys due to insufficient entropy may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
  type: Confidentiality
- consequence: Weakening of encryption mechanisms due to predictable or weak cryptographic keys may result in unauthorized decryption of sensitive communications.
