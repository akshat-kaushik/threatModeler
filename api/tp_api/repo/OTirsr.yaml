name: Improper resource shutdown or release
cwe: 404
description: Specially crafted Profinet packets sent to the affected device might cause the device to go into defect mode, effectively causing a DoS. A cold restart is required to recover the system.
mitigations:
- description: Implement robust input validation mechanisms to ensure that only valid and expected Profinet packets are processed by the device. 
      Validate packet structure, length, and content to detect and reject malformed or malicious packets.
  phase: Implementation
- description:  Implement rate limiting measures to control the rate of incoming Profinet packets and detect anomalous traffic patterns indicative of DoS attacks. 
      Deploy traffic monitoring tools to analyze network traffic and detect suspicious or unauthorized packet activities.
  phase: Implementation
risk:
- consequence: Manipulation of Profinet packet processing, potentially resulting in unintended device behavior and loss of operational control.
  type: Integrity
- consequence: Disruption of device availability and critical operations due to defect mode triggered by malicious Profinet packets.
  type: Availability

test-cases: 
- name: automated-vulnerability-scanning
  test: Run automated vulnerability discovery tools to identify improper resource shutdown or release vulnerabilities in the affected device.
  tools: [nmap,nessus,openvas]
  type: discovery
- name: manual
  test: Test for improper resource shutdown or release vulnerabilities manually, as part of a penetration test or bug bounty program.
  type: manual
