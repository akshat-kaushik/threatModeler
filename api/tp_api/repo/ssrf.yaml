name: Server-Side Request Forgery
cwe: 918
description: The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.
mitigations:
- description: Consider scanning dependencies for SSRF vulnerabilities, including infrastructure components like Apache
  phase: Implementation
- description: Consider implementing a URL whitelist to reduce the possibility of an attacker-controlled URL being resolved by your application
  phase: Implementation
- description: Consider implementing additional Header validation to sensitive paths like EC2 Metadata, etc to mitigate the effects of an existing SSRF flaw
  phase: Implementation
risk:
- consequence: Unauthorized users may be able to gain access to sensitive information in internal/protected system components
  type: Confidentiality
test-cases:
- name: automated-vulnerability-scanning
  test: run automated vulnerability discovery tools to identify SSRF
  tools: [burpsuite,zap]
  type: discovery
- name: manual
  test: test for misconfigured AWS S3 Buckets manually, as part of a Pentest or Bug-bounty
  type: manual
