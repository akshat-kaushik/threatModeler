name: hmi
description: In most SCADA/ICS installations, there is a dedicated system for managing and monitoring the industrial system. Most people in the industry refer to this as the human machine interface or HMI. This system is crucial to the management the industrial system but also can be a critical vector for attackers. If the attacker can compromise the HMI, they own your industrial network!
